# Notes during the Development
- Use HTTP request/response cycle in the Express context.

- Four main HTTP actions:
  - GET: The GET method retrieves data about a resource.
  - POST: The POST method (usually) creates a new resource.
  - PUT: The PUT method updates the existing data of a resource.
  - DELETE: The DELETE method deletes a specified resource.
